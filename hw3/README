Oh, if in anycase you were not able to open the hw3.pdf, I would like to inform
that I, unintentionally might have encrypted the assignment with my private
key.
This is a very careless mistake on my part :(

Anyways, my gpg key id is 0x6C40FE13. If you do not find anything with the
keyid, try searching for 'mfrw', maybe that might help.

-mfrw
